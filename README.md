# Project-2
# House Price Prediction 
This project includes application of a Machine Learning model along with a dataset.House Price Index (HPI) is commonly used to estimate the changes in housing price. Since housing price is strongly correlated to other factors such as location, area, population, it requires other information apart from HPI to predict individual housing price.With the introduction of the power of machine learning in predicting house prices using Python has revolutionized the real estate industry.
By applying various ML algorithms like Linear regression we have tried to build the desired output.
We have used Kaggle kc_house_data dataset.
